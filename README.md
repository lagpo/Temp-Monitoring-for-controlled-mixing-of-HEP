# Temp-Monitoring-for-controlled-mixing-of-HEP
This project presents the design and development of a non-contact infrared temperature monitoring system based on a PIC microcontroller. 
The preparation of high-energy propulsive materials in defense laboratories requires strict thermal 
control to ensure safety and effectiveness of the mixing process. During the preparation, it is critical to 
maintain the temperature of Composition A at exactly 60Â°C before introducing Composition B for 
further processing. This sensitive operation is carried out by heating Composition A using hot water 
circulated through a jacketed mixing bowl. Due to the hazardous nature of the materials involved and 
the temperature-sensitive nature of the process, real-time monitoring without human presence in the 
danger zone is essential. 
The system integrates EEPROM for data logging and utilizes I2C protocol for interfacing peripherals 
including an OLED display, Real-Time Clock (RTC), and the IR sensor. A custom PCB was designed 
to house the entire system in a compact and reliable form suitable for deployment in high-risk 
environments. This solution enhances process automation, safety, and thermal accuracy in the mixing 
of propulsive materials, demonstrating the practical use of embedded systems in critical defense 
applications.
